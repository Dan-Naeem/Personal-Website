                        Hi there,
                        <br> <br> As you've probably already figured out, my name is Daniyal Naeem and I am an aspiring software developer. I have a background in C++ and Python and easily prefer the latter. With respect to web development, I have built websites and applications using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and React. I have also created mobile apps using Java and React Native. React and React Native are my favorite frameworks, as I like the idea of making modular and reusable React components, injecting them with functionality to carry out work, and being able to design apps for both Android and iOS simultaneously. Outside of coding, I am really excited to see how technology evolves and what ends up in the laps of consumers; from new smartphone innovations (3 rear-facing cameras!?) to the next great IoT device, like playing Fortnite on your smart fridge.

                        I am an avid music listener, and with headphones on my ear more often than not, I use music as a way to escape, relax, and if I'm working, let's say, on my personal website, I use it to focus and get in the zone.

                        When I was in middle school, my go-to artists were Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, and Eminem. There was something about those artists and their songs that just fit the mood of 'being in middle school'. I can, to this day, recite the words of 'In The End'. When I'm in the mood for a trip down memory lane, I just hop on Spotify and shuffle one of the albums. RIP Chester Bennington.

                        Nowadays, I listen to a wider range of music. I try to expose myself to new genres and artists, in hopes of finding the next song that I'll listen to on repeat until I get sick of it. My genres of choice include House, Trap, Rap/Hip-Hop and Lo-fi.

                        I got into the EDM scene because of artists like Avicii (RIP), Swedish House Mafia, Hardwell, and Skrillex. Even though I am not a huge fan of dubstep, there are some songs out there that have had a huge impact on me, including the infamous montage song Monster, and the banger of a song Make it Bun Dem that I heard while completing a mission in Far Cry 3.

                        Currently, I am addicted to Rocket League. For those who may have seen gameplay of it but can't recall the name, 'car soccer' is its second name. This game is unlike any other game out there. To put it another way, no other game can provide an experience even remotely similar to that of Rocket League. With the refined mechanics and unparalleled game physics, this game is easily one of the best games out there. Rocket League has also entered the esports scene, with large organizations, like TSM, Cloud9, and G2, competing for a cut of the prize pool, currently set at over $1,000,00. With around 900 hours put in the game, I am currently hovering between Diamond 1 and Diamond 2. Road to Champ 1?

I recently bought myself a piano and practice on it when I can. I have managed to come up with a few short tunes while going through the grueling process of teaching myself Beethoven's Fur Elise.
